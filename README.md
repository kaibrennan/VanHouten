# Van Houten
Repository for all information and research concerning the ghost town of Van Houten (the coal mining village in Colfax, N.M.), and its culture.

---

## Overview
Van Houten, located in Colfax County, New Mexico, was once a thriving coal mining village established as the Willow Mining Camp in 1902. A true American melting pot, it was built by immigrants from diverse backgrounds, including Dutch, Germans, Austrians, Italians, Montenegrins, Greeks, and African Americans. The town was renamed in honor of Jan Van Houten (/jɑn vɑn ˈɦʌu̯.tən/ Yahn vahn HOW-ten), who revitalized the struggling camp and saved it from economic collapse.
Van Houten flourished until 1954, when the post-war decline in coal demand and the rise of alternative energy sources led to its abandonment. In the 1960s, most of the town’s structures were demolished due to changing tax codes. Today, the remnants of the tipple, mule barn, and a few standing houses serve as enduring reminders of the town’s rich history and cultural heritage.
